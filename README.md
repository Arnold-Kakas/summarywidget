SummaryWidget is an [HTML widget](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) which works with
[Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/index.html) to display a single
summary statistic. The statistic updates when the Crosstalk selection changes. A SummaryWidget can display the count, sum or mean of one column of selected data.
It can also have a fixed filter that selects a subset of the full dataset.

For more information and examples see the
[full documentation](https://kent37.github.io/summarywidget).
